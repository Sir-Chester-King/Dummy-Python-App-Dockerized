## Main Application
The application ask to an user to answer a simple question via terminal command (NO GUI), and it wrote in [Python](https://www.python.org).<br>
Questions available are:
```
questions = {
    "Who is the first American's President?": "B",
    "When was the second world war?": "A",
    "In which country was invented the pizza?": "C"
}
```
As you can see, it was used a dictionary for the questions to use the pair <ins><em>Key: Values</em></ins> to bind the correct answer with the correct question.

<a name="main.py"></a>
### Main.py
This function is structured with the questions and the correct answers, store in the main body of application.<br>
After that, it call another function called [New_game.py](#new_game.py)<br>

<a name="new_game.py"></a>
### New_Game.py
Thsi function use a nested <mark>FOR cycle</mark> to iterate first one, the questions dictionary (to show one question per time), and the second one, the answer (to show all possible answer per question).
```
    # Iterate over the questions and print them
    for key in questions.keys():
        print(F"Question number {count_questions}: {key}")
        print("Options:")

        # So, question number 1 ---> answer number [question - 1]
        for index in possible_answer[count_questions - 1]:
            print(index)
```
The variable index "<strong>count_questions</strong>" start from one 'cause it was used to show the number of question showed to user (ex: question number Â°1).
